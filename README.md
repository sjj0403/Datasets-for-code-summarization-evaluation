# Datasets-for-code-summarization-evaluation
Two public Java datasets are available in the datasets folder.   
Both ref.json files are extracted from Github, separately by Hu et al.(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8973050) and LeClair et al.(https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02660)    
can.json files are generated by the Seq2Seq model for code summarization and the code can be available in the model folder.  
The metrics folder supplies six automatic metrics code, contains BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, CIDEr-D and CSCE.  
The results folder records the scores of different metrics on above two datasets.
